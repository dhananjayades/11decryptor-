Dot11decrypt requires a wireless interface in monitor mode .

Appropriate information required to decrypt the encrypted traffic.

I recommend tcpdump, wireshark, ngrep, as interprets network traffic to analyze the decrypted traffic.

WEP: The access point's BSSID( MAC address) and the WEP key and WPA2: access point's SSID and the PSK
